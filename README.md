KMeans parallelization




Preparation: Get familiar with KMeans algorithm.

#### Task 1 (3p):
Implement a C++ version that uses either an existing dataset or just randoms N=1 mil points in a 2D space, and clusters them in 5 clusters.



#### Task 2 (5p):
Provide a thread level parallelism and show your results, different report metrics as we worked in the Lab.


##### Task 3 (2p):
Parallelize with SIMD using intrinsics too, on top of Task 2.
